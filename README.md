## Project Overview
In this project, I developed an optimization model to improve the logistics network for Lavazza, a global coffee producer. The goal was to assess cost-saving opportunities by redesigning the network to incorporate an additional satellite warehouse. Using linear programming, the model evaluates various scenarios to identify optimal warehouse locations and distribution methods, reducing transportation costs by over 15%.

The analysis focused on:
- Evaluating Lavazza's current logistics network and identifying inefficiencies.
- Developing an optimization model to explore the impact of introducing a satellite warehouse.
- Providing actionable recommendations to improve Lavazza’s operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and linear programming model development
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing
- **Microsoft Excel**: Scenario analysis and data visualization
- **Canva**: Presentation of findings and recommendations

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains logistics data used for model inputs and cost calculations.
- `Code/`: Jupyter Notebook for the optimization model and analysis (`Compagnone_Stefano_Lavazza_Optimization.ipynb`).
- `Output/`: Final report and presentation file (`Lavazza Case - Team 9.pdf`).

## Key Insights
- Implementing an additional satellite warehouse can reduce Lavazza’s logistics costs by approximately 15.36%.
- The model identified Warehouse 4 as the optimal location for the satellite warehouse, resulting in the lowest total cost.
- Switching from less-than-truckload (LTL) to full-truckload (FTL) deliveries in certain routes contributed significantly to the cost savings.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Compagnone_Stefano_Lavazza_Optimization.ipynb`) in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Ensure that required libraries (like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy.optimize`) are installed.
4. Run the notebook to explore data analysis, model scenarios, and optimization results.
5. Review the final recommendations in `Output/Lavazza Case - Team 9.pdf`.
